# install dependencies { bare minimum }
npm install

# Run Project as:
npm start

# Test project as:
npm run test

# Test Coverage for project can be generated as
npm run test -- --coverage
Testing has been achieved by using Jest https://facebook.github.io/jest/docs/getting-started.html#content and Enzyme https://github.com/airbnb/enzyme

At the time of submitting the first set of code ( almost complete ) the code coverage was > 96%
